# REPAN (Regular Expression Pattern Analyzer)

The aim of the repan project is to perform various tasks
on regular expressions except pattern matching. Repan
can parse various regular expression flavors, can analyze
or optimize them, and can construct new pcre patterns which
match to the same strings as the original patterns.

#### Building

To build the project, simply run:

    make

Debugging can be enabled using CFLAGS

    CFLAGS="-DDEBUG_REPAN"

The location of the repan library is *out/librepan.a*

#### Using the library

Include *include/repan.h* in your project, and link it
wtih *out/librepan.a*. The patterns can be parsed by the
*repan_parse...* functions, and a new pattern can be
generated by *repan_to_string_...* functions. The patterns
can be modified by *repan_opt_...* functions.

Further pattern modifications can be added to the project,
and it is encouraged to do so. The patterns are compiled
to a tree which nodes can be manipulated by varios helper
functions.

#### Testing

Tests can be run by *tests/run_test.py* script. Verbose
can be enabled by *-v*. All test files and their expected
output are simple *.txt* files, so a text viewer can be
used to check the effect of various pattern modifications.
